# SilliconValley
This is a [GIPHY](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/giphy-capture-the-gif-maker/id668208984?mt=12) demo of a game built for Data Structures at Berkeley, taught by Josh Hug. I'm not allowed to post the code here for academic honesty reasons, so feel free to e-mail me for it if you're not a Berkeley student.

# World Generation
Upon entering the game, the user is prompted to enter a seed, and the code generates a deterministic, randomly generated world for gameplay to happen.
